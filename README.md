## Overview

The goal of this repository is to apply KDD methodologies to a dataset, covering the stages from data preprocessing to knowledge extraction. The main objectives are:
- **Data Cleaning and Preparation:** Removing noise and handling missing data.
- **Data Transformation:** Feature engineering and transformation techniques.
- **Data Mining:** Applying algorithms for pattern recognition and prediction.
- **Evaluation:** Assessing model performance and extracting meaningful insights.
